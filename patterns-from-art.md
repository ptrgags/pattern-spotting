- Page 0
    - hatching pattern (3 short parallel lines pasted in random directions)
    - dashed lines
    - river delta (tree-like patern where smooth curves eminate from a common area)
        - ❓How would you simulate this with bezier curves? share some control points but then diverge?
    - Dots along a path
    - spirals
    - interwoven ribbons
- Page 1
    - Coral patterns
    - isolines
    - tree of line segments
    - pentagram fractal (start with a star, then draw a star at the 5 points, and so on)
    - wheat pattern (like a cropped herringbone brick pattern?)
    - plaid (thick stripe + thin stripe in opposite direction)
    - contour lines inside
    - radiating lines
- Page 2
    - double spiral
    - coral
    - hyperbolic sierpinski triangle 
    - refining polyline to fit curve
    - polar grid
- Page 3
    - arc stripes (like thin stripes, but bent lines)
    - neurographic art
    - hyperbolic/elliptic mobius tranformation tiling 
        - or... grid on globe under stereographic projection from the equator
- Page 4
    - crinkle arc fractal
    - hyperbolic tiling
    - integer arcs on a circle
    - leaf venation patterns
    - circle packings
        - related: polka dots are a bunch of (usually large) circles with gaps
        - circle packings are where circles are tangent
- Page 5
    - two-disc tilings
    - intertwined circle permutations
    - Pile of partially overlapping rectangles
- Page 6
    - one-point perspective pile
    - ...zipper? not sure what to call it. Not quite a herringbone, more like (in this case rounded) rectangles overlapping back and forth along a column
    - Tree inside coral pattern
    - nested clipped circles... I forget what you call this spatial data structure
    - dashes that follow a curve
    - quarter circles overlapping so they make astroid and lens shapes
- Page 7
    - scales (in this case triangles, but I also use rounded arcs sometimes)
    - Drawing behind windows
        - digitally, easier to just draw a frame over drawing
        - This one looks like an edge matching tiling - except the tiles are held apart by a little bit
    - shingles pattern (rectangles partially overlapping to fill a region) - similar to zipper
        - this one is quite regular, usually I do something more 
    - cross hatching
    - loop-de-loop
- Page 8
    - Minimum spanning tree of a graph
        - this one also draws the full connections behind it
    - Single dot in each box
    - Odd-even coloring
    - Coral with circles at the tips colored
        - in the coral implementation, this would be easy to do - just gather the leaf circles!
    - coral used as clouds
    - zigzag pattern
    - color every other tile
    - Color random tiles
    - Hyperbolic connections, but wavy paths in between
