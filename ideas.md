# Ideas

This page is a place to put rough ideas for patterns before I'm ready
to write an outline.

## List of Ideas

- solid fill
    - Visually a very simple pattern
    - in music, this could map to a few different things
        - a drone note/chord
        - holding any parameter constant
- stripes
    - Even stripes (same width on and off) are like a square wave
    - Even stripes are like a steady rhythm with rests in between
    - variation: non-uniform stripes
        - Like a pulse wave/PWM on a synth
        - connection: Pokemon cries chained multiple pulse widths together to make more waveforms
        - barcodes
    - variation: many colors
    - variation: warp the stripes into waves and other shapes
- plaid
- brick walls
- mazes
- boolean operations
    - clipping masks
    - set operations
    - blend modes
    - CSG operations (e.g. SDFs in a shader)
    - Relation to logic
    - variation: compositing operators (like over, holdout, etc.)
- Regular polygons
- Musical scales
    - piecewise linear functions
- Timelines
    - p5-sketchbook: used for music (a la Haskell School of Music)
    - p5-sketchbook: used for animation curves
    - could also be used to represent historical timelines (especially comparing simultaneous events)
- fencepost vs gaps
    - Evenly spacing points is a very common thing that needs to be done
    - Easy to get off-by-one errors, so let's make diagrams and explore the math
    - variation: evenly spacing things around a circle (what changes about the math?)
- Fourier series
    - Shows up a lot in acoustics - harmonic series, spectrograms
    - In music, harmonic series are produced by acoustic instruments
    - Can also be used for imagery
    - difference between sound and visuals
        - our visual system detects _shapes_, i.e. spatial domain, not spatial frequencies
        - our auditory system detect _frequequencies_, not the shape of the resulting waveform
    - symmetry-sketchbook: fourier series look cool! Based on _Creating Symmetry_
    - Plenty of good resources on this topic, see e.g. 3Blue1Brown
- Harmonic series
    - additive synthesis - organs
        - Drawbar organ: two osc additive synth
        - osc 1: partials 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, skip, 8
        - osc 2: partials 1, skip, 3
    - Low frequencies tend to have higher amplitudes
        - true of sawtooth, triangle, square wave
    - when revising a creative work, often good advice is do the most obvious thing first
        - I know that was mentioned in Syntorial when trying to match a synth patch by ear
        - EDIT: looking at different variations on this idea, maybe it's less about the harmonic series and more about filtering/EQ-ing an arbitrary distribution?
    - clearing up space (physical/digital storage)
        - make a list of what you have from largest to smallest (volume/byte size/etc)
        - Start evaluating the biggest items first as these have the biggest impact on storage
    - different decluttering technique
        - make a list of what you have
        - for each item, evaluate how important it is to you
        - keep the important things
        - get rid of the not important things
        - zoom in on middle region since that's more noisy
    - Performance testing
        - measure first to get a sense of the "spectrum" of performance issues
        - fix the biggest bottleneck first
        - like a high pass filter in terms of attenuating the bad performance
    - modeling shape with fourier series
        - low frequencies give the overall shape
        - higher frequencies add detail
        - need infinite series to get perfect straight lines.
    - Image processing
        - low spatial frequencies are most important, they give the overall shape of the image
        - higher spatial frequencies are less intense,
        they give increasingly finer details.
- binary trees
    - spatial data structures like kd-trees
    - balanced brackets
    - ruler pattern
- Sine waves
- sawtooth waves
- evenly spaced points in a circle
    - like a clock
    - symmetrical scales and chords in music
        - chromatic - step size 1
        - whole tone scale - step size 2
        - fully diminished chord - step size 3
        - augmented triad - step size 4
        - tritone - step size 6
    - Modular arithmetic
- Euclidean rhythms
    - music - used for rhythms
    - piano keyboard - gives an explanation for why the keyboard is arranged the way it is (even though the real reason is a long history)
    - Also describes problems like "I have 5 dishes in a dish rack that holds 8 dishes - how do I spread them apart as evenly as possible?
- grids
- cross stitching
- braids
- Wang tiles
    - in pixel art video games, used for tilemaps
    - music... How would you make "tiles" of measures? what are the edge conditions? what about stacking things vertically, what are the edge matching conditions?
- concentric circles
- voronoi diagrams
- arpeggios
- celtic knots/mirror curves
- isometric grid pattern
- coral patterns
    - how I draw them on paper
    - As a curve around a tree (like I did in p5-sketchbook:AnimatedTangle)
    - related to self-avoiding walks
        - on a grid
        - find that Bridges paper on self-avoiding curves?
        - cutting out a shape with sciessors - similar to Matisse algae
    - tape echo has coiled tape that makes similar patterns, but that has self-tangent curves
    - that attempt at quad-based coral rendering I never quite finished...
- frieze patterns

    - Applied to timelines
- Monoids
    - List summarizers
    - art - which blend modes are monoid operations?
    - timelines (music or otherwise) - monoid in each operator
- Multiple mappings from visual parameters to musical parameters
    - pitch -> hue, lightness, chroma, height, 
    - lightness -> pitch, volume, synth params, etc.
- Dice algorithms
    - generating patterns on a grid
    - aleatoric music
- CSG operations
    - what shapes can you make with these operations + basic shapes?
    - shows up in SDFs
    - Shows up in clipping masks
- oscillator sync
    - related to polyrhythms/polymeter?
    - visually, it's like overlapping tiles slightly
- mosaic tiles
    - start with small units of material
    - combine motifs into larger tiles
    - combine tiles into a larger work
    - connection: proteins have a similar structure
- recursively nesting structures
    - discography > album > song > song structures > ... > note
    - library > section > stacks > shelf > book > chapter > paragraph > sentence > word > level
    - art gallery
- logarithmic scales
    - Music: volume (dB scales)
    - Music: semitones are a log scale of frequencies
    - entropy/information content uses log probability
    - Chemistry: pH scale
- Animal gait
- dithering
    - Helpful for adding more (color) values when colors are limited (e.g. 1-bit display)
    - more general version (with greyscale gradient rather than dither pattern) can be used for transitioning between two images (think Powerpoint slides)
- hitomezashi patterns
    - used in paper-toaster
    - used in embroidery
    - used in p5-sketchbook:AnimatedTangle
- Drawing a circle
    - parametric equation
    - implicit equation
    - Geometric algebra (related to implicit)
    - complex number implementation
    - Explicit rendering as center, radius
    - SDF version
    - variation: use a different distance function
- normalized ranges
    - signed: [-1, 1]
    - unsigned: [0, 1]
    - In practice, sometimes we have to use integers, e.g. `u8, i8`
    - On synths
        - unipolar: a signal with an unsigned value
        - bipolar: a signal with a signed value
    - converting between them
        - unsigned -> signed: `signed = 2 * unsigned - 1`
        - signed -> unsigned: `unsigned = 0.5 + 0.5 * signed` (inverse)
            - obscure trig function: haversine is basically an unsigned version of cosine
- projection/constructor pattern
    - projection takes a type and splits it into multiple parts
    - constructor takes the parts and combine them into the whole
    - Category theory
        - categorical product is a tuple type
        - only defined up to isomorphism
        - the projection functions and the constructor (when inverses) are an isomorphism to the categorical product
    - `floor, fract <-> add` 
        - project from $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Z} \times [0, 1]$
        - to construct the 
    - real/imag part of a complex number, `a + bi` is the constructor
    - `vec.x, vec.y, vec.z` are projections, `vector(x, y, z)` is a constructor
    - `(row = index // cols, row = index % cols)` and `rows * cols + index` when converting 1D to 2D grid indices
    - `sign, abs`, `sign * abs`... kinda. Have to be nitpicky about the domain of these functions to handle zero correctly
    - MIDI note number <-> octave, pitch class
        - observation: mathematically this is the same as 1D <-> 2D indices!
        - more generally you can think of dividing frequency range (semitones from a reference pitch) into octave, semitones, cents 
    - Gamepad joystick axis to left/right signals: `left = max(x_axis, 0), right: min(x_axis, 0)` <-> `left + right`
    - bit twiddling to pack/unpack multiple fields from a single integer
        - constructor: `packed = BITWISE_OR(i, field[i] << shift[i])`
        - projections: `field[i] = (packed >> shift[i]) & mask[i]`
    - object oriented programming: struct(a, b, c...) is a constructor, object.a, obj.b, obj.c getters are projections
        - note that you can also _modify_ individual fields
    - Digital colors have multiple possible projections
        - sRGB <-> R, G, B components (bit twiddling or object-oriented color)
        - oklch <-> lightness, chroma, hue
        - color space <-> a, b, c in general
        - Using color space transformations, you can 
            - though transformations may not always be invertible...
    - decomposing audio signal
        - projection: compute FT at a specific frequency
        - constructor: compute inverse FT for full spectrum
    - Raster Tangles grammar rule
        - projection: Decompose pixels by sub-region address. Also decoration pixels
        - constructor: union of sub-regions and decoration
    - Lego set: building from bricks, disassembling into bricks
        - interesting detail: there are steps to disassembly
        - curiosity: what is the structure of combining bricks? in theory union of bricks is fine, but in practice, a model falls apart if bricks are not physically connected
    - partitioning a set, unioning it back together
    - digital art: splitting an image file into layers, compositing them
        - this only works for project files (`.psd, .kra`, ...I forget the extension for GIMP... `.xcd`?). For flat raster formats, composition is lossy!
        - vector graphics are more easily split/merged
- FM synthesis
    - sidebands - find YouTube videos about this
    - When do sidebands relate to harmonic series?
