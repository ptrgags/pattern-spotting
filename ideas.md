# Ideas

This page is a place to put rough ideas for patterns before I'm ready
to write an outline.

## List of Ideas

- solid fill
    - Visually a very simple pattern
    - in music, this could map to a few different things
        - a drone note/chord
        - holding any parameter constant
- stripes
    - Even stripes (same width on and off) are like a square wave
    - Even stripes are like a steady rhythm with rests in between
    - variation: non-uniform stripes
        - Like a pulse wave/PWM on a synth
        - connection: Pokemon cries chained multiple pulse widths together to make more waveforms
        - barcodes
    - variation: many colors
    - variation: warp the stripes into waves and other shapes
- plaid
- brick walls
- mazes
- boolean operations
    - clipping masks
    - set operations
    - blend modes
    - CSG operations (e.g. SDFs in a shader)
    - Relation to logic
    - variation: compositing operators (like over, holdout, etc.)
- Regular polygons
- Musical scales
    - piecewise linear functions
- Timelines
    - p5-sketchbook: used for music (a la Haskell School of Music)
    - p5-sketchbook: used for animation curves
    - could also be used to represent historical timelines (especially comparing simultaneous events)
- fencepost vs gaps
    - Evenly spacing points is a very common thing that needs to be done
    - Easy to get off-by-one errors, so let's make diagrams and explore the math
    - variation: evenly spacing things around a circle (what changes about the math?)
- Fourier series
    - Shows up a lot in acoustics - harmonic series, spectrograms
    - In music, harmonic series are produced by acoustic instruments
    - Can also be used for imagery
    - difference between sound and visuals
        - our visual system detects _shapes_, i.e. spatial domain, not spatial frequencies
        - our auditory system detect _frequequencies_, not the shape of the resulting waveform
    - symmetry-sketchbook: fourier series look cool! Based on _Creating Symmetry_
    - Plenty of good resources on this topic, see e.g. 3Blue1Brown
- binary trees
    - spatial data structures like kd-trees
    - balanced brackets
    - ruler pattern
- Sine waves
- sawtooth waves
- evenly spaced points in a circle
    - like a clock
    - symmetrical scales and chords in music
        - chromatic - step size 1
        - whole tone scale - step size 2
        - fully diminished chord - step size 3
        - augmented triad - step size 4
        - tritone - step size 6
    - Modular arithmetic
- Euclidean rhythms
    - music - used for rhythms
    - piano keyboard - gives an explanation for why the keyboard is arranged the way it is (even though the real reason is a long history)
    - Also describes problems like "I have 5 dishes in a dish rack that holds 8 dishes - how do I spread them apart as evenly as possible?
- grids
- cross stitching
- braids
- Wang tiles
    - in pixel art video games, used for tilemaps
    - music... How would you make "tiles" of measures? what are the edge conditions? what about stacking things vertically, what are the edge matching conditions?
- concentric circles
- voronoi diagrams
- arpeggios
- celtic knots/mirror curves
- isometric grid pattern
- coral patterns
    - how I draw them on paper
    - As a curve around a tree (like I did in p5-sketchbook:AnimatedTangle)
    - related to self-avoiding walks
        - on a grid
        - find that Bridges paper on self-avoiding curves?
        - cutting out a shape with sciessors - similar to Matisse algae
    - tape echo has coiled tape that makes similar patterns, but that has self-tangent curves
    - that attempt at quad-based coral rendering I never quite finished...
- frieze patterns
- wallpaper patterns
- L-system fractals
- IFS fractals
- sierpinski triangle
    - IFS fractal
    - "triforce" subdivisions
    - parity of Pascal's triangle
    - Elementary cellular automata
    - L-system with hexagon angles
- walking bass lines
- Chord structures (music)
- Transformations
    - linear
    - projective
    - conformal
- Tangles
    - Tangle Grammars
    - Drawn on paper
    - raster-tangles implementation
    - VectorTangle in p5-sketchbook
    - Applied to timelines
- Monoids
    - List summarizers
    - art - which blend modes are monoid operations?
    - timelines (music or otherwise) - monoid in each operator
- Multiple mappings from visual parameters to musical parameters
    - pitch -> hue, lightness, chroma, height, 
    - lightness -> pitch, volume, synth params, etc.
- Dice algorithms
    - generating patterns on a grid
    - aleatoric music
- CSG operations
    - what shapes can you make with these operations + basic shapes?
    - shows up in SDFs
    - Shows up in clipping masks
- oscillator sync
    - related to polyrhythms/polymeter?
    - visually, it's like overlapping tiles slightly
- mosaic tiles
    - start with small units of material
    - combine motifs into larger tiles
    - combine tiles into a larger work
    - connection: proteins have a similar structure
- recursively nesting structures
    - discography > album > song > song structures > ... > note
    - library > section > stacks > shelf > book > chapter > paragraph > sentence > word > level
    - art gallery
- logarithmic scales
    - Music: volume (dB scales)
    - Music: semitones are a log scale of frequencies
    - entropy/information content uses log probability
    - Chemistry: pH scale
- Animal gait
- dithering
    - Helpful for adding more (color) values when colors are limited (e.g. 1-bit display)
    - more general version (with greyscale gradient rather than dither pattern) can be used for transitioning between two images (think Powerpoint slides)
- hitomezashi patterns
    - used in paper-toaster
    - used in embroidery
    - used in p5-sketchbook:AnimatedTangle
