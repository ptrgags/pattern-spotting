# Pattern Spotting

In all my creative works, I'm always making use of patterns. This includes
everything from concrete visual and musical patterns to abstract mathematical 
patterns.

This repository is for me to catalogue notable patterns with examples
and recipes for implementing them. I'm particularly interested in exploring
connections between disciplines. For example, the following diagram
might be representing a zig-zag frieze pattern in art, or perhaps an
up-and-down arpeggio pattern in music:

```
   --      --      --      --   
  -  -    -  -    -  -    -  -   
 -    -  -    -  -    -  -    -   .  .  .
-      --      --      --      -
```

## Index

Patterns:

- [Stripes](./stripes.md) - `| | | | | | | `
- [Structure/Destructure](./structure-destructure.md) - disassemble something into its parts, then put it back together again
- [Patterns in Space and Time](./space-time.md) - Comparing images, audio, animation by which space/time dimensions are used

Other Pages

- [Ideas](./ideas.md) - This file is a place to jot down rough ideas to be fleshed out later.

## Goals

- Highlight patterns that show up across art, music, math and other topics
- Include recipes on how to implement the pattern in various media
- Include links to examples in my own creative projects as well as those
others have made
- Include variations on patterns to generate new ideas
- Update incrementally
