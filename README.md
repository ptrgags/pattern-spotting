# Pattern Compendium

Everything I do with art, math, programming, music involves patterns. I
want to document them all in one place.

## Pages

- [Ideas](./ideas.md) - This file is a place to jot down rough ideas to be fleshed out later.

## Goals

- Highlight patterns that show up across art, music, math and other topics
- Include recipes on how to implement the pattern in various media
- Include links to examples in my own creative projects as well as those
others have made
- Include variations on patterns to generate new ideas
- Update incrementally
